# Multi-Class-image-Classifier
The Project aims to classify images from the corresponding dataset into 15 different classes of animals,foods and flowers.
There are over 6400 images and the images are of different resolutions and sizes.

Here are some images from the dataset.

I have used tranfer learning in keras and have used pretrained weights of VGG19 and Mobilenet to train my model.
Different variations of hyperparameters and optimizers were tried on the dataset and the best results were saved along with the code and the model.
